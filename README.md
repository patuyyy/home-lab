# Patuyyy's Homelab

**[Features]() • [Get Started]() • [Documentation]()**


This project focuses on documenting the setup, configuration, and continuous development of my homelab. It serves as a personal learning platform where I experiment with various technologies in networking, virtualization, monitoring, and security. Over time, it can also be used as a reference or framework for others who want to build their own homelab environment.

> **What is a homelab?**
>
> Homelab is a laboratory at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies, practice for certifications, and so on.
> This repository documents my journey in building and maintaining a **personal home lab**, starting from the physical setup to the deployment of various software and services.  
The purpose of this project is to create a flexible, self-managed environment for continuous learning, experimentation, and hands-on practice with modern IT infrastructure.
